## Introduction

Regression analysis is a fundamental technique in machine learning and statistics used to predict a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. It comes in two primary flavors: linear and non-linear regression. This repository covers the foundational concepts of both types of regression and includes a section on feature engineering, an important aspect of model development.

## Linear Regression

Linear regression is the simplest form of regression, assuming a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It includes:

### Simple Linear Regression

- **Overview**: In simple linear regression, there is one independent variable, and the relationship with the dependent variable is modeled using a straight line.
- **Equation**: `y = mx + b`
- **Derivation**: The least squares method is used to derive the coefficients `m` and `b`. For a detailed derivation, refer to [Linear Regression Derivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression).

### Multiple Linear Regression

- **Overview**: Multiple linear regression extends to multiple independent variables, allowing you to model more complex relationships.
- **Equation**: `y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ... + bn*xn`
- **Derivation**: The coefficients are derived using matrix notation. For details, see [Multiple Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Multiple_linear_regression).

### Cost Function

- **Overview**: The cost function measures the error between predicted and actual values, which optimization algorithms aim to minimize.
- **Equation**: `J(b0, b1, ..., bn) = (1/2m) * Σ(yi - ŷi)^2` for all data points.
- **Derivation**: The cost function is derived from the squared error. Learn more at [Cost Function in Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Cost_function).

### Gradient Descent

- **Overview**: Gradient descent is the optimization algorithm used to adjust model parameters to minimize the cost function.
- **Equation**: `b = b - α * ∂J(b0, b1, ..., bn)/∂bi` for all coefficients.
- **Python Example**: Below is a Python example using NumPy for gradient descent.
    ```python
    import numpy as np

    def gradient_descent(x, y, alpha, epochs):
        m = len(y)
        theta = np.zeros(x.shape[1])

        for _ in range(epochs):
            predictions = np.dot(x, theta)
            errors = predictions - y
            theta -= (alpha / m) * np.dot(x.T, errors)

        return theta
    ```

### Feature Scaling

- **Overview**: Feature scaling, such as Z-score normalization, ensures that all features are on a similar scale for more stable training.
- **Equation**: Z-score normalization: `z = (x - μ) / σ`, where `μ` is the mean and `σ` is the standard deviation of the feature.
- **Python Example**: Below is a Python example using NumPy for Z-score normalization.
    ```python
    import numpy as np

    def z_score_normalization(x):
        mu = np.mean(x, axis=0)
        sigma = np.std(x, axis=0)
        scaled_x = (x - mu) / sigma
        return scaled_x
    ```

## Non-Linear Regression

Non-linear regression is used when the relationship between variables is not linear. This section covers:

### Polynomial Regression

- **Overview**: Polynomial regression captures non-linear relationships by introducing polynomial features.
- **Equation**: `y = b0 + b1*x + b2*x^2 + ... + bn*x^n`
- **Example**: To implement polynomial regression in Python, you can use libraries like scikit-learn or manually create polynomial features.

### Overfitting and Underfitting

- **Overview**: Understanding overfitting and underfitting helps find the right balance between model complexity and generalization.
- **Example**: You can visualize overfitting and underfitting by plotting learning curves and validation curves.

### Regularization

- **Overview**: Regularization techniques, like L1 and L2 regularization, help prevent overfitting in non-linear models.
- **Python Example**: You can use scikit-learn to apply regularization to models. For example, use `Lasso` or `Ridge` regression.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the predictive power of your models. It's an essential step in model development.
